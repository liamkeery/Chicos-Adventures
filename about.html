      Since she was a child, Jen Dafoe experienced ongoing visits to health care facilities for treatment of a variety of health issues. These multiple visits taught Jen to persevere, to be patient and to try to face the challenges of treatment and operations with optimisim and to become more knowledgeable about her procedures and what impact they might have both on her physicial and emotional well-being. Jen believes that the more knowledge you have, the more you are able to better understand "what it's all about" and that helps reduce stress and anxiety.
